The Top-Level Functionalities in the experiment are:
1)A dropdown menu to display the languages that are available.
2)When the words are selected,"reform-the-sentence" button is being activated.
3)After clicking the "reform-the-sentence" button,the words are put back and there would be a chance to reselect them.
4)Once,all the words are selected,"Check the corectness of this sentence" button is activated.
5)If the answer you submit is wrong,a button that says, "get correct answer" is activated.
6)After clicking the button to get the answers,you will be shown all the possible answers.
7)Besides these features,it would be useful if we get the count of words that we already selected while reforming the sentence.
8)If in case, the answer is right,it would be better to activate a button that says,"hide the correct answer" so that the right answer is hid.
